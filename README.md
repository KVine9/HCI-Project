# HCI-Project

A project that allows the user to receive information about any artist, album, song specified. 

The project also allows the user to see certain data in other forms:
Score Effectiveness Bar Chart - where users can see a bar chart comparing the numeric score the entries have to the request term.
Song Length Scatterplot - where users can see all the entries' song length displayed via a scatterplot
Media Map -  where users can see where on the world all the entries' orginated from

This projects uses the MusicBrainz API and Streamlit to create a funcitonal website.
This project also follows some HCI practices like a monotony interface, modeless feedback, and reduced excise.
