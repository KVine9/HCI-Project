# HCI-Project

A project that allows the user to receive information about any artist, album, or song specified. 

The project also allows the user to see certain data in other forms:
Score Effectiveness Bar Chart - where users can see a bar chart comparing the entries' numeric score to the request term.
Song Length Scatterplot - where users can see all the entries' song lengths displayed via a scatterplot
Media Map -  where users can see where on the world all the entries originated from

This project uses the MusicBrainz API and Streamlit to create a functional website.
This project also follows some HCI practices like a monotony interface, modeless feedback, and reduced excise.
